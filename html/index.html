        <h2>W T feat. Piotr R -<br>"W W Is W"</h2>
        <p>You live your life.<br>You go day by day<br>
        Like nothing can go wrong.<br>
        Then scars are made,<br>
        They're changing the game.<br>
        You learn to play it hard.<br>
        </p>    
        <p>I know you wish for more,<br>
        And I know you try.<br>
        And I hope you realize,<br>
        You know the time is right.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The whole world is watching<br>
        When you rise.<br>
        The whole world is beating<br>
        For you right now.<br>
        Your whole life is flashing<br>
        For your eyes.<br>
        It's all in this moment that changes all.<br>
        </p>
        <p>What are you waiting for?<br>
        What are you fighting for?<br>
        Cause time's always slipping away.<br>
        The whole world is watching.<br>
        Yeah, the whole world is watching you<br>
        When you rise.</p>
